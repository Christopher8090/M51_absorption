### Order of Operation
1. To run the dust emission calculations for a certain model, simply run the `*_numaster.sh` files for the appropriate model. For example, to run the dust emission calculation for the model with scattering calculated with the LMC dust, one would run `> source lmc_sca_numaster.sh`.
