Description of parameters:

Diagnostics - When turned on this tells the code to print the emissivity and opacity profiles to a file in the file "out/profiles". These profiles can be used as a sanity check for the geometry of the model.

Prof_lim - Defines the truncation radius of the diagnostic profiles.

izero - Sets the model to be absorption only (extinction) or scattering (attenuation).

dust_model - This sets the dust model to be used in your model. Dust models currently avaliable in the "indata" directory are those of Weingartner & Draine (2001), and the dust model used in Popescu (2000) and Tuffs et al (2004).

dist - Sets the distance to the modelled galaxy in Mpc.

Inclination - Sets the inclination of the model in degrees.

Pixel size - The size of each pixel on the surface brightness map in arcseconds.

X is a place holder for the following parameters b, n, i, m, o are for the bulge, nuclear, inner, main, and outer components respectively.

nx_X, Ny_X - The number of pixels in the surface brightness maps along the vertical and horizonal direction axis respectively. NB - Make sure the total physical size of the map fully covers the extent of the  modelled component.

mask X - Are triggers which let you turn on strip masks for your model. Using these masks can significantly decrease computation time for large maps.

N is a placeholder for 1, 2, or 3.
mstepN_X - Number steps along the horizontal axis. In each step there is 1 unmasked vertical strip, and mstepN_X-1 masked vertical strips.

mlengthN_X - The number of vertical strips which mstepN_X is valid. For example if mlengthN_X=100 and mstepN_X=5 there will be 20 unmasked vertical strips, and 80 masked vertical strips.    

elm_X - The radius along the major axis an ellitical mask. Set this equal to 0 for no mask. This mask is useful for components which have a hole in the centre. Using the elliptical masks for these components will significantly decrease the computation time for large maps.
